    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p1> This carrot Bundt cake gets an extra boost of moisture and flavor thanks to the addition of both pureed and grated carrots. Crushed pineapple also adds a nice bright note. The cake is topped with a light, sweet cream cheese glaze. Feel free to add some chopped walnuts or pecans to the batter, if you wish. </p1>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> baking spray with flour</li>
            <li>2 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 10-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour.. </li>
        <li>Sift together cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over another large bowl. Pour crushed pineapple into the strainer, and use the back of a spatula or wooden spoon to press out as much moisture as possible. This should yield about 1 cup drained pineapple. Reserve pineapple juice for another use.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!        </li>
    </ol>
